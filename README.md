# Deft

**Deft** is a personal clarity engine and project management tool.

Unlike traditional task managers or note-taking tools, Deft is designed to help you **break down complex goals into manageable parts**, **visually map dependencies**, and **capture thought processes, questions, and decisions** â€” all in one place.

---

## âœ¨ Purpose

Deft exists to solve a real problem:

> It's easy to follow structured learning (like a course), but hard to create your own structure from scratch.

Deft helps you:

- Define a project or goal
- Break it down into structured sections
- Add steps, notes, todos, and questions inside each section
- Link steps together with dependencies
- Think through problems without losing context or clarity

## ðŸ“Œ MVP Scope

- [ ] Create a new project/goal with a title
- [ ] Add freeform **sections** under the project
- [ ] Each section can include:
  - [ ] Notes
  - [ ] Todos
  - [ ] Questions
- [ ] Mark progress on steps
- [ ] Toggle between reading and editing modes
- [ ] Store all data locally for now (no backend)

## ðŸ§  Why Markdown, .txt files, or Notion didnâ€™t work

- Writing alone didnâ€™t give structure
- Notion was too open-ended
- Dependencies and inter-step thinking were missing
- Switching between tools created friction
- I kept looping on the same problems â€” Deft is my way out
